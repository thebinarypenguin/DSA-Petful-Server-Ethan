## Summary

Welcome to Petful! We're an adoption service that operates strictly on a
"first-in, first-out" basis. We offer FIFO style adoption services for dogs and
cats. A wonderful dog or cat will be presented to you in the order they came
into our shelter. You will be given 60 seconds to decide if you want the current
dog or cat.
